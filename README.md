It is said that a child has 1,000 - 3,000 vocabulary words in their repertoire. A grown adult has 5,000 - 8,000, and an English professor would have around 10,000 words. That means, if you can learn about 1,000 or so words you will be able to more or less communicate and survive in another country.
